### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<h2>Who am I?</h2>

This is Pablo: one brain trapped in a healthy body who loves coding! I studied industrial engineering back when I was an unexperienced child. Following the path I chose, I started my career as an engineer. I currently work as it (designing machinery, btw), but what really sets my heart on fire is problem solving and automation. Cutting down technical problems applying logic and maths is something I truly enjoy, and I am addicted to the satisfaction returned by a succesful algorithm. Throughout the years, I've found out that this satisfaction is maximised by programming. For this reason, I decided to change my career direction towards development.

Currently studying FPGS-DAW - Web Applications Development (first year completed)


<h2>What have I done so far?</h2>

Please note that the following projects/courses have been made entirely by me alone while working full-time as an engineer.

1) Game App: I developed a full game which I released on the Google Play Store (2017), called "Race Zero". Remarkable lessons and milestones of this project:
  - Learnt Unity and C# (kind of).
  - I had no idea about OOP at the time, so my code is absolute trash...but it worked! I wouldn't code things even remotely like that         again, but I had a lot of fun doing it.
  - I made every aspect of the game by myself (except for the music, which was copyright-free). This is, I draw all the assets (learnt some   illustrator and photoshop skills) and I coded everything, including the NPC racers, game modes, saving, menus, etc.
  - The game is greatly inspired by the SNES game F-Zero, but I implemented some original game modes and mechanics.
  - I spent 0 â‚¬ and earnt a little bit, so I can't complain.

  As apparently I didn't update some Google Play terms, it got removed from the Store, but you could download and install the apk here:
  

2) RPG project (2022-2023): I started to develop a 2D RPG game intended for desktop and mobile. This is a more complex project and it's not finished, but I completed a demo. Please note that I learnt concepts about OOP and refactoring that I would definitely apply to this project now, after studying first year of DAW. I identify bad quality code in this project that I would change if I had to start it over or refactor it. You can download the apk for Android here:

4) Studying FPGS-DAW (2023-2024) - Web Applications Development on semi-attendance: the methodology is online except for the exams. Completed first year with top grades of my group. I remark the following lessons off of this course:
  - I've learnt Java in good detail, including the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (which I didn't know to the RPG game I was       developing, but I'll do from now on).
  - JavaScript, which I learnt by coding a responsive personal website with clear/dark theme and also a To-Do List webpage (LocalStorage).
  - Definition of SQL databases (drawing Entity-Relation diagrams and schemes).
  - I have studied SQL and PL/SQL in great detail (sub-queries, left and outer joins, triggers, functions) using PostgreSQL and dBeaver.
  - Regular expressions and basic Linux commands and management.

  My grades here (average 9.67 / 10):

  You will be able to find some of the projects done during the course here on my github.

4) I'm working on a DataBase to use in my current company, where I work as engineer. I intend to create a basic CRM from scratch to digitalise some parts of the processes of the company so it can be more competitive. I am defining the database through dBeaver using PostgreSQL and the idea is to code some Java programs to automate a variety of tasks accessing the database with IntelliJ drivers for PostgreSQL.
This is the Entity-Relation diagram I defined for this task:

<h2>English?</h2>
It is well-known that English is the language to-go when talking about IT. I have a certificed C1 English level (Cambridge English: Advanced (CAE)).

<h2>Android?</h2>
Finally, I would like to express my passion for mobile development. The games I developed have been intended and designed for Android. On the other hand, I actually started DAW (the W stands for web) and not DAM (the M stands for Multi-platform) because there was no option for DAM on semi-attendance, but they both share the first year. Now I'm trying to change and continue the second year on DAM. During the summer "holidays" (I'm still working as an engineer) I'm following an Android development course from Frogames to keep learning. The course:

I'm happy to attend any further questions, so feel free to contact me :)
