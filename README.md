### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<h2>Who am I?</h2>

This is Pablo: one brain trapped in a healthy body who loves coding! I studied industrial engineering back when I was an unexperienced child. Following the path I chose, I started my career as an engineer. I currently work as it (designing machinery, btw), but what really sets my heart on fire is problem solving and automation. Cutting down technical problems applying logic and maths is something I truly enjoy, and I am addicted to the satisfaction returned by a succesful algorithm. Throughout the years, I've found out that this satisfaction is maximised by programming. For this reason, I decided to change my career direction towards development.



<h2>What do I want?</h2>

I am learning slowly but surely, on the side, combining my studies with my work as engineer. However, the ideal path for me would be to take a graduate programme, so I could reach my goal faster while keep paying my bills.

<h2>What have I done so far?</h2>

Please note that the following projects/courses have been made entirely by me while working full-time.

1) Game App: I developed a full game which I released on the Google Play Store (2017), called "Race Zero". Remarkable lessons and milestones of this project:
  - Learnt Unity and C# (kind of).
  - I had no idea about OOP at the time, so my code is absolute trash...but it worked! I wouldn't code things even remotely like that         again, but I had a lot of fun doing it.
  - I made every aspect of the game by myself (except for the music, which was copyright-free). This is, I draw all the assets (learnt some   illustrator and photoshop skills) and I coded everything, including the NPC racers, game modes, saving, menus, etc.
  - The game is greatly inspired by the SNES game F-Zero, but I implemented some original game modes and mechanics.
  - I spent 0 â‚¬ and earnt a little bit, so I can't complain.

  As apparently I didn't update some Google Play terms, it got removed from the Store, but you can download the apk here to play (more info on my "Race Zero" repository:

2) RPG project (2022-2023): I started to develop a 2D RPG game intended for desktop and mobile. This is a more complex project and it's not finished, but I completed a demo. Please note that I learnt concepts about OOP and refactoring that I would definitely apply to this project now, after studying first year of DAW. I identify bad quality code in this project that I would change if I had to start it over or refactor it.

You can watch part of the demo here:

4) Studying FPGS-DAW (2023-2024) - Web Applications Development on semi-attendance: the methodology is online except for the exams. Completed first year with top grades of my group. I remark the following lessons off of this course:
  - I've learnt Java in good detail, including the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (which I didn't know to the RPG game I was       developing, but I'll do from now on).
  - JavaScript, which I learnt by coding a responsive personal website with clear/dark theme and also a To-Do List webpage (LocalStorage).
  - Definition of SQL databases (drawing Entity-Relation diagrams and schemes).
  - I have studied SQL and PL/SQL in great detail (sub-queries, left and outer joins, triggers, functions) using PostgreSQL and dBeaver.
  - Regular expressions and basic Linux commands and management.

  My grades here (average 9.67 / 10):

  You will be able to find some of the projects done during the course here on my github.

4) I'm working on a DataBase to use in my current company. I intend to create a basic CRM from scratch to digitalise some parts of the processes of the company so it can be more competitive. I am defining the database using SQL and PL/SQL on dBeaver and the idea is to code some Java programs to automate a variety of tasks accessing the database with IntelliJ drivers for PostgreSQL.
This is the Entity-Relation diagram I defined for this task:

<h2>English?</h2>
It is well-known that English is the language to-go when talking about IT. I have a certificed C1 English level (Cambridge English: Advanced (CAE)).

<h2>Android?</h2>
I would like to express my preference for mobile development. The games I developed have been intended and designed for Android. I have some experience with Java but I believe I should change to Kotlin, that's why now I'm following an Android development course from Frogames to keep learning. The course:
