### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<h2>Who am I?</h2>

My name is Pablo and I love coding! I studied industrial engineering and I currently work as it (designing machinery, btw), but what really sets my heart on fire is problem solving and automation. Cutting down technical problems applying logic and maths is something I truly enjoy, and I am addicted to the satisfaction returned by a succesful algorithm. Throughout the years, I've found out that this satisfaction is maximised by programming and building things. For this reason, I decided to shift my career towards development.



<h2>What do I want?</h2>

I am learning development on the side, combining my studies with my work as engineer. I always find myself dedicating my free time working on personal IT projects, and it would be great to do this for a living.

<h2>What have I done so far?</h2>

1) Game App: A game I released on Google Play Store (2017), called "Race Zero". Remarkable lessons and milestones of this project:
  - Learnt Unity and C# (kind of).
  - I had no idea about OOP at the time, so my code is highly inefficient...but it worked! I had a lot of fun doing it.
  - I made every aspect of the game by myself (except for the music, which was copyright-free). This is, I draw all the assets and coded everything, including the NPC racers, game modes, saving, menus, etc.

  As apparently I didn't update some Google Play terms, it got removed from the Store, but you can download the apk here to play (more info on my "Race Zero" repository):

2) RPG project (2022-2023): Currently developing a 2D RPG game intended for desktop and mobile. Full game will launch eventually, meanwhile you can try a demo.

You can watch part of the demo here:

4) Studying FPGS-DAM (2023-2025) - Multiplatform Applications Development on semi-attendance: the methodology is online except for the exams. Completed first year with top grades of my group. I remark the following lessons off of this course:
  - I've learnt Java and Kotlin in good detail, including Object-Oriented Programming good practices.
  - I have built different apps (the frontend side) using Android Studio and Jetpack Compose.
  - I have built Java and Kotlin programs that interact with SQL and NoSQL databases using Spring Boot, Hibernate and jdbc drivers for PostgreSQL, SQLite, MySQL.
  - JavaScript, which I learnt by coding a responsive personal website with clear/dark theme and also a To-Do List webpage (LocalStorage).
  - Definition of SQL databases (drawing Entity-Relation diagrams and schemes).
  - I have studied SQL and PL/SQL in good detail (sub-queries, left and outer joins, triggers, functions) using PostgreSQL and dBeaver.
  - Regular expressions and basic Linux commands and management.

  My grades here (average 9.67 / 10):

  You will be able to find some of the projects done during the course here on my github.


<h2>English?</h2>
It is well-known that English is the language to-go when talking about IT. I have a certificed C1 English level (Cambridge English: Advanced (CAE)), and I actually use it on a daily basis on my current job as engineer.

<h2>Android?</h2>
The games I developed have been intended and designed for Android. I have learn Kotlin, Jetpack Compose and Android Studio to a point where I feel pretty confident about my skills. Nonetheless, I'm always eager to work on web or desktop also.

<h2>Other stuff</h2>
